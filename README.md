# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create a SQL database that could determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Many employees were at the age of retirement and the company wanted to be prepared for that so they would be able to hire new employees accordingly.
